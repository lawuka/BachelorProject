<!--******************************************************************************
*
*  Example of Component for biochip design. Components can be created
*  as wanted, though with constrains to already existing components.
*
*  Basic components are FlowChannel and Connection.
*  All components must have at least a width and a length.
*  All components must have at least 2 external connections (in-/output)
*
*  Components can be created from other components, though the placement
*  inside, needs to be predefined. Components used inside, need already
*  be defined in the library, else the program fails.
*
*  Each component inside, is placed according to X,Y coordinate system, where
*  0,0 is bottom left of the hole width and length. X and Y are based on 1mm.
